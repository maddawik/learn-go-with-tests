# Learn Go with Tests

["Learn Go with Tests"](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests) is an
incredibly good and *free* resource for learning Go and TDD (test-driven
development) at the same time.

The code here is not a 1-1 copy of the code in the [official
repo](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests) - it's *my version* - which
is pretty much the same gumbo. I've changed some tests and examples to fit my
taste and done some extra credit for a few exercises - that's it.

I've made a concious effort to build a commit history that is granular and
hopefully helpful to future me (and others) who want to get a clear story of
how the solutions for each of these examples comes together.
